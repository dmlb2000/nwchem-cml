1. Build FoX library 
   - Make sure same compilers are used by FoX and NWChem 
     Set FC and CC to point to the one you're going to sue in NWChem, for example gfortran and gcc
   - Make sure you use same integer size in FoX and NWChem. 
     NWChem uses Integer*8, FoX by default does Integer*4.
     Set FCFLAGS=<appropriate I8 flag for compiler, i.e. -fdefault-integer-8 for gfortran).
   - Type configure   
   - Type make

2. Set up environment variable FOXHOME to point to FoX location

3. Set up build environment NWChem following instructions on www.nwchem-sw.org/index.php/Compiling_NWChem

4. Build NWChem
   - Use "make -j1" so only one compile job happens at the same time in the util directory.
     When you use gfortran, "make -j1 FC=gfortran" is waht you would use.
